<h2 id="how-can-i-attend">How can I attend?</h2>

<p>Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.</p>

<p>If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the registration form (<span class="todo">WBS to be done</span>. We want to fill the room with people with practical experience of both Web and VR technologies.</p>

<p>Because the venue can accommodate unfortunately only 100 attendees, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on <a href="#dates">these important dates</a>.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the registration form, you are encouraged to submit a presentation topic in the form of a <a href="#position-statements">position statement</a>.</p>

<p>Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="todo">A list of communities should appear here, e.g.,</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manga/cartoon content producers</li>
    <li>Reading systems</li>
    <li>Authoring tool providers</li>
    <li><span class="todo">etc.</span></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under its <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2 id="topics">Which topics will be covered?</h2>

<h2 id="position-statements">How can I suggest a presentation?</h2>

<p>This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.</p>

<p>In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.</p>

<p>If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement (<span class="todo">WBS to be set up</span>) by the deadline (see <a href="#dates">important dates</a>). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.</p>

<p>A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your background in the main <a href="#topics">topic areas</a> of the workshop.</li>
  <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.</li>
  <li>Links to related supporting resources.</li>
  <li>Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.</li>
  <li>A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.</li>
  <li>Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.</li>
</ul>
